        <p class="info-description">
            Vegetarianism is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of meat (red meat, poultry, seafood, and
            the flesh of any other animal), and may also include abstention from by-products of animal slaughter.
            Vegetarianism may be adopted for various reasons. Many people object to eating meat out of respect for
            sentient life. Such ethical motivations have been codified under various religious beliefs, as well as
            animal rights advocacy. Other motivations for vegetarianism are health-related, political, environmental,
            cultural, aesthetic, economic, or personal preference.

            There are variations of the diet as well: an ovo-lacto vegetarian diet includes both eggs and dairy
            products, an ovo-vegetarian diet includes eggs but not dairy products, and a lacto-vegetarian diet includes
            dairy products but not eggs. A vegan diet excludes all animal products, including eggs and dairy. Some
            vegans also avoid other animal products such as beeswax, leather or silk clothing, and goose-fat shoe
            polish.
